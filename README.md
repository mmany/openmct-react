# OpenMCT-React Integration Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of integrating an [OpenMCT](https://github.com/nasa/openmct) instance within a React.js web application. The integration allows you to easily embed OpenMCT widgets within a React application and leverage the features of both libraries.

## Overview

OpenMCT is a web-based mission control framework that provides a customizable dashboard for visualizing telemetry data. React, on the other hand, is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By combining the two libraries, you can create powerful applications that display telemetry data in real-time.

This demo includes a simple web application built with React and OpenMCT, using the Vite bundler and basic styling with Tailwind CSS. The application includes a server built with Express.js and websockets for telemetry data, based on the [OpenMCT tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial).

## Usage

To use this demo, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure that NodeJS and npm package managers are installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/mmany/openmct-react
cd openmct-react
npm install
```
2. Start the telemetry server
```
node telemetryServer/server.js
```
The telemetry server should be running on port 8080.

3. Start the React app on a separate terminal
```
npm run dev
```
The web app should be running on port 5173 by default and can be accessed at http://localhost:5173/.

### Customization

To customize the demo, you can modify the telemetry data or change the styling. The telemetry data is generated by the `telemetryServer/server.js` file, which sends data over a websocket to the React app. You can modify this file to send different telemetry data or use a different data source.

The styling for the React app is based on Tailwind CSS, and can be modified by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file or creating a custom CSS file.
